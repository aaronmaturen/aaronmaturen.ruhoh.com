	For the presentation I will create a monster themed Web Application using MV* architecture and Backbone.js through the presentation and application I will explain how JavaScript benefits from Design Patterns to prevent ‘monstrous code’.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      An alarming amount of web developers have adopted JavaScript by tying their data directly to the DOM. When web applications use a lot of javascript, this becomes a hinderance and prevents efficient, maintainable javascript. It becomes a monstrous task keeping the data in sync between the HTML UI, the Javascript Logic, and the database model. For rich client-side applications developers can utilize the same design patterns that they’ve used for years to make their applications more structured and maintainable. Through Design Patterns developers force their applications to become more modular, containing a set of highly decoupled, distinct pieces of functionality.</p><p>Presented on November 17, 2012</p>
